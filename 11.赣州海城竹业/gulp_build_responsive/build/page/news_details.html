                        Ganzhou Haicheng Bamboo Industry Co., Ltd. was established in August 2020 and is located in
                        Tianxin Industrial Base, Quannan County Industrial Park, Ganzhou City, Jiangxi Province. The
                        legal representative of the company is Mr. Lin Junhua, with a registered capital of 6 million
                        yuan and an area of approximately 26 acres. The company utilizes the abundant bamboo resources
                        in surrounding counties (cities) to mainly produce bamboo sticks and bamboo flower sticks, and
                        mainly exports them abroad.

                        Bamboo sticks, bamboo flower sticks and other bamboo products are popular low-carbon and
                        environmentally friendly necessities in the market. With the modernization of China's social
                        economy, changes in people's lifestyles and the improvement of living standards, social demand
                        will further increase. But currently, although there are many bamboo product enterprises, most
                        of them are transitioning from family workshops to corporate operations, and there is an urgent
                        need for influential benchmark enterprises to emerge to occupy the market high ground and play a
                        leading role in the industry. At present, our company has the following advantages:
