                        Plans by UK cargo firm Air One International Holdings and Dutch company Peso Aviation Management

                        acquire Air Belgium’s cargo business have fallen apart after a court revoked the takeover

                        Air One and Peso gained court approval for their proposed takeover of struggling Air Belgium’s
                        cargo
                        business in December, however, according to media reports, the Nivelles enterprise court revoked
                        the
                        acquisition process on 6 March.

                    <p class="lead">
                        The next step in the acquisition process was due to involve securing the required operating and
                        aviation licences from the Belgian aviation authorities.

                        To complete the purchase, a new company, Air One Belgium (AOB), was being created. This entity
                        was
                        due to be 51% owned by Peter Scholten of Peso and 49% owned by Air One.

                    <p class="lead">
                        The company was expected to acquire Air Belgium’s cargo business assets, contracts, and
                        essential
                        personnel.

                        In September 2023, Air Belgium said it had decided to discontinue its own passenger business and
                        focus exclusively on “cargo and ACMI for passenger and cargo flights” due to economic challenges
                        that have resulted in the airline acquiring debt.

                        But while the airline underwent a judicial restructuring, it has been seeking investors to

                        financial stability.
